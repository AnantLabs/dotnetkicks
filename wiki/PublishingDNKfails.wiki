#summary What to do when "Publish" fails for DNK

= Introduction =

This document describes an issue users of VS 2k5 may experience when attempting to publish the DotNetKicks solution.

= Symptoms =

When attempting to publish the DNK solution to a configured website, the publish fails, even though FrontPage extensions are configured on the server.  The Output window contains error messages starting with "Unable to create" and ending with "Internal Server Error".

= Details =

DNK uses UrlRewriter.NET, which requires that all requests be mapped through ASP.NET through configuring the wildcard handler.  When this is done, FrontPage server extensions are broken as their requests must be handled by FrontPage, not by ASP.NET.

To fix this, the FrontPage folders underneath the website root (called {{{_}}}vti_bin) must be configured to be an application folder.  The wildcard mapping can then be removed for this directory.
